- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashley Osborne
- 👀 I’m interested in improving NICU parent discharge readiness, their understanding of prematurity and their emotional well-being.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from NICU families how we can better support them during admission & the transition home.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NICU mHealth/eHealth interventions.
